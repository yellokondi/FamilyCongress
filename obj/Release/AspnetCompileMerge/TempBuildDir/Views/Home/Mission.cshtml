<h2>Faces of Love – Parents</h2>
<h2>We are all called to love and educate</h2>

<p>
    Every day we are becoming convinced that our personal fate and the fate of our loved ones, as well as
    fate of all mankind depends the most on what happens between a man and a woman, and especially
    between husband and wife and between parents and children. Nothing gives as much happiness as
    mutual love of spouses until death. Nothing hurts as much as lack of this love. That’s why the first
    commandment God directs to Adam and Eve is regarding marriage and family.
</p>
<p>
    The foundation of a happy marriage as well as of a permanent and happy family is love between a
    husband and a wife and between parents and children. Happy family is one in which everyone loves
    everyone else. Those engaged who decide to become sacramentally married in a Catholic Church do not
    only take a solemn vow of mutual love. They also vow to accept with love and raise their children
    Catholic as well as to fulfill their marital and parental obligations with God’s help.
</p>
<p>
    Marital crisis begins when one of the spouses fails to show love to the other spouse, when both spouses
    neglect to raise the children according to Catholic teaching or if they become estranged from God,
    namely when they stop relying on His help to be a faithful spouse and a responsible parent.

    During the II Congress the conference sessions – just as they were during the I Congress – will be
    delivered by Dr. Marek Dziewiecki (Radom). His conferences will be about different faces of love within
    marriage and family. Love is a special kind of relating to another person on account of which the other
    wants to live and which gives strength to the other to manage well even in very difficult situations in life.
    Love, the kind taught by Jesus, is manifested in care, fidelity, responsibility, honesty, perseverance, in
    continuous conversion in order to love those closest to us more intensely and more wisely. Loving after
    the example of Jesus is to be ready to give our life for our loved ones. It means to treat one’s spouse and
    children as greatest treasures on earth. It means to become a defense fortress for them and a witness
    of God’s love for man.
</p>
<p>
    An important form of love within marriage and family is raising the children according to Catholic
    teaching. It is necessary here to beware of two extremes. First extreme occurs when parents try to love
    their children but make no demands on them and do not establish necessary boundaries. They do not
    teach them discipline or moral values. In consequence, they mistake raising children for pampering and
    leniency. Pampered children will not be able to face the demands of life, because after the original sin
    each one of us, at least some of the time, must confront hard reality that spoils no one. The other
    extreme occurs when parents make demand on their children and teach them the Decalogue but fail to
    support their children with love. As a result, the children feel unloved and have no energy to develop.
</p>
<p>
    To be a responsible, Catholic parent is to both love and demand. It is easiest to raise and educate
    children that feel loved. A child feels most loved and safe when it sees that mom and dad love one
    another. Therefore the primary form of love of parents to children is love of dad for mom and mom for
    dad. Love directed by parents to their child is manifested by tenderness, patience, and affection. The
    first principle of parental love is the presence of mom and dad by their child, namely it’s the time
    devoted to the offspring.
</p>
<p>
    To love and raise children is to support their development. It’s to bring them to Jesus. It’s to teach them
    to pray and form their conscience according to the Decalogue and the Gospel. It is to teach sons and
    daughters discipline and industriousness day after day. It is to help children learn how to love their
    neighbor so that as adults they will be able to form their own happy, permanent families. It is to fascinate children with the wisdom and goodness of Jesus. It is to defend their purity and innocence. It is
    to help them become like Jesus, meaning holy. Well raised children motivate and help their parents to
    grow, because they make demands on them too.
</p>
<p>
    We are all called to love and educate those we love. All – meaning, not only those who are good
    examples and do not struggles with serious problems. To love and educate their loved ones are also
    called those who feel battered and painfully afflicted, who went through a cross, a break-up,
    abandonment and rejection. Each one of us can learn about what mature love is from Jesus and thus to
    become a blessing to our loved ones.
