'How to thrive and benefit from being loved and educated.',
'According to the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 338, “The Marital union of man and woman… is  by its very nature ordered to the communion and good of the couple and to the generation and education of children.”  St. Pope John Paul II also described the family as a “school of love.”  When people know they are loved, they thrive and do well.  Love creates a deep sense of identity, purpose and eventually destiny.  The love of God experienced in the Church and Christian family is meant to transform us.  The fruit of love and education is on-going conversion (holiness).  God calls us all to this life of holiness.  The conviction to bear credible witness to our faith flows from the knowledge and experience of being loved.  How do we open up ourselves to the love of God?  We have to let go off anyfalse images of love and painful past experiences.  Through my personal journey of faith, I hope to call everyone to a deeper encounter with Jesus Christ and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.  In the words of St. Paul, “nothing can separate us from the love of God.” (Romans 8:31ff)')

'We are all called to love and educate, myths, lies and truth in today''s sexual education.',
'As we are all called to love and educate.  I would like to take a closer look at today''s current comprehensive sex education and compare and contrast it with a more thoughtful and effective approach that centers on abstaining until marriage.  I would incorporate into this talk some of the teaching of Saint John Paul II, both from theology of the body and his earlier work, love and responsibility.  This talk will focus on the dangers associated with premarital sex both from a physical health point of view as well as the psychological implications of sexual activity outside the confines of marriage.  I will try to formulate the talk to appeal not only to parents who may need advice on how to keep their children chaste and safe, but also for teens and young adults who may be contemplating or feeling the pressure to become sexually active.  One only need to look at current societal decay and the crumbling of the family unit to realize that we must change direction when in comes to speaking to our children about their sexuality.')

'Bringing the Theology of the Body in our great vocation of marriage: <br />St. John Paul II''s vision of love and life.  This great message of the "Theology of the Body" answers the questions we have about our bodies and what we are created for, issues on sexual morality, and how it is integrated in our vocation as a husband, as a wife, and as parents (for those gifted with children).')
