VALUES('Hallina and Jerzy Florczyk', 'Animators', 
'Halina and Jerzy Florczyk have been married since 1967. People often congratulate them and ask what is the  most difficult thing in a relationship. The answer is short: love that is not selfish, does not get angry, bears everything, and does not hold grudges – just as St. Paul wrote in the letter to the Corinthians. Love can be difficult, but if one seeks solutions to problems, they can be found. In their search in 1987,  they  stumbled  upon  religious  retreat  for  married  couples.  The  3-day program  for  all  marriages,  the  good  ones  and  the  lost  ones, has  confirmed their  understanding of  marriage. Right after the  first weekend, they became animators  for  the  program  and  continue  this  good  work  until  today.  In  the present day, the institution of family needs  much help, and marriage retreats are reaching out towards that need, offering continuation. All participants of the  first  weekend  can  attend  additional  meetings  as  long  as  they  need. Oftentimes,  realizing  the  great  benefits  they  receive,  they  also  become animators.
